		<p>
            This was a project made for my Senior Capstone. I worked with a team of 5 other students
            and we designed a forum prototype for our client CVG located in Cincinatti. I was the only
            programmer on the team so I mostly worked on the backend of the site. I worked on building the database using SQL, 
            weaving the php into the the html files that my classmates gave me and making sure that the website 
            was at an operational level for our clients. <br> <br>

            Our team consisted of a project lead, 3 programmers (2 front end and 1 backend), a graphic designer, and a data collector <br> <br>

            We started by talking with the client and accessing their needs and then doing some basic research
            using surveys. After our initial survey, we worked with the client to come up with the idea for a forum for their employees. 

            We started doing some basic mockups and then a static version of the page, eventually moving on to design the backend. <br><br>

            The backend consits of a login page with the ability for both users and admins to access the site at the same time. Users are able to make new posts, add comments, and report posts. Admins have all the privledges of a regular user along with the ability to aprove and remove posts.<br> <br><br>

            Note: I took this Capstone when I was a Softmore with limited knowledge of php a Database construction due to me 
            needing to meet the requirements of multiple majors. I joined halfway through this capstone, since my team members needed a programer so 
            I was not there for the initial project research. <br> <br>

            Below are some of our powerpoint presentations updating our client on our project progress. <br> <br><br>
